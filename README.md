# edrpg-py Project

## Overview

`edrpg-py` is a Python-based project of tools for the Elite: Dangerous RPG. This project is currently in its initial phase, featuring a solar system generator. Future expansions are planned to include character creation tools and other utilities.

## Features

### Solar System Generator

- **Dynamic Creation**: Generate unique solar systems with a variety of stars, planets, asteroid belts, and orbiting stars.
- **Customizability**: Systems can be configured to be inhabited or uninhabited, influencing the presence of structures like stations, outposts, and settlements.
- **Detailed Attributes**: Each celestial object is generated with specific attributes like type, size, habitable zones, and more.
- **Inhabitation Logic**: Implements probabilities for planets to be inhabited based on their type and the system's overall habitability.
- **Economy and Society Simulation**: Systems are assigned specific economies and societal structures, enhancing the depth of the role-playing environment.

### Future Implementations

- **Character Creation Tools**: Utilities to assist players in creating and managing characters in the game.
- **Additional Generators**: Tools for creating other aspects of the game world, such as unique NPCs and missions.
- **Virtual Tabletop**: Eventually, a web-based interface for these tools, as well as broader campaign management.

## Getting Started

To use the solar system generator:

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. **Running the Generator**:
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the script using Python: `python system.py`.
   - The script will generate a solar system and output a detailed summary.
